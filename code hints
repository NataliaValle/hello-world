RELATIVE POSITION z-index: 2 (to change the position among elements- higher values for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.)
    display:flex - it puts diferent divs at the same level
    justify-content/items: for COLUMNS - center/space-between etc - To arrange the colmns
    align-content/items: for ROWS (horizontal)

**flexible layouts according to page size** grid-template-columns: repeat (auto-fill, minmax(60px, 1fr);
        auto-fit: as the page size changes, it moves stuff around to organize it accordingly filling up the space
        auto-fill: does the same but it squeezes every item to the side
        minmax: it varies the size of the item according to the screen size (min, max)
        repeat: for not to have to asign one by one the same size to each item
